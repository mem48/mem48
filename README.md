I'm a Senior Research Fellow at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds, UK. My research interest are in transport, housing, urban planning, energy and decarbonisation. I teach GIS and R programming. Iâ€™m best known for building Carbon & Place (www.carbon.place) a free set of map-based tools about local carbon footprints.
